Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, a dragon lived in a dense forrest. She spent her days frolicking amongst the trees and smelling each and every flower.
One day, a woodland nymph crossed her path and said, "Dragon, I need your help! My family is in danger and only you can protect us!"  


	Then the dragon ate the nymph. There was no happy ending. Indeed, it was quite fatal. Reality
is often disappointing.

After a long day of paying the bills by frolicking, the dragon went home to her wife and kids as she did every night. To her surprise, her home was ransacked and her family nowhere to be found.
The dragon panicked. The only clue of her family's wherabouts was a golden crown laying ominously on her kitchen table.
