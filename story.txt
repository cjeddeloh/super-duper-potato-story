Caroline Jeddeloh, x2 and x3 Story Repo

Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, a dragon lived in a dense forrest. She spent her days frolicking amongst the trees and smelling each and every flower.
One day, a woodland nymph crossed her path and said, "Dragon, I need your help! My family is in danger and only you can protect us!"  


	Then the dragon ate the nymph. There was no happy ending. Indeed, it was quite fatal. Reality
is often disappointing.
